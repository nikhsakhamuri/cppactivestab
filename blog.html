						<h1>Join The Journey</h1>
						<p> We, the team of Active Stabilization, strongly believes the impact that stories, experience, and mentorship can bring. This year, we have many great faces, and a diverse background of different majors, and we want to note the importance of this in our team. Early on, we wanted to show all aspects of a research project, and to depict the highs, lows, and in-betweens of academic life. To accomplish this, we created a blog series, written by our very own team members and leads. In their posts they depict the work they do in Active Stabilization, as well as describe their journey into their current standings. These blog posts truly set an example for the various backgrounds that create our project, and as a Cal Poly Pomona project team, we are very proud to be exemplifying this.  </p>
